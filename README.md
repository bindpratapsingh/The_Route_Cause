# The Route Cause - AI-Powered Traffic Management System  
**Submission for Smart India Hackathon 2025**  


---

## The Problem We Solve  
Traditional traffic lights use static timers, leading to unnecessary congestion, long wait times, and an inability to respond to real-world events like emergency vehicles or sudden traffic jams.  
Our system solves this by bringing intelligent, adaptive control to urban intersections.

## Our Multi-Layered AI Solution  

### Real-Time Perception (The Eyes)  
A YOLOv8 computer vision model provides real-time situational awareness, detecting and counting every vehicle and pedestrian.  

### Intelligent Decisions (The Brain)  
A trained Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning agent analyzes the live data to make strategic decisions on signal timing to minimize congestion.  

### Optimization & Safety (The Supervisor)  
A rule-based Optimization Engine supervises the AI's decisions, enforcing critical safety and fairness rules like emergency overrides and starvation prevention.  

This data is then streamed via a FastAPI backend to a live React dashboard for visualization.

## Key Features & Innovations  

- **Adaptive AI Control**: Dynamically allocates green lights based on live traffic density.  
- **Emergency Vehicle Preemption**: Executes a professional-grade clearing sequence (yellow -> all-red -> dedicated green) for emergency vehicles.  
- **Dynamic Queue Management**: Intelligently overrides the cycle to service excessively long queues and prevent gridlock.  
- **Fairness Guarantee**: A "starvation" timer prevents any vehicle from waiting indefinitely.  
- **Real-Time Data & Transparency**: All perceptions and decisions are streamed via WebSockets to a live dashboard for complete system transparency.
