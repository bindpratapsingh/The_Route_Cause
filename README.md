# üö¶ The Route Cause - AI-Powered Traffic Management System  
**Submission for Smart India Hackathon 2025**

## The Problem We Solve  
Static, pre-programmed traffic signals are fundamentally inefficient. They cannot adapt to:

- Sudden traffic surges during peak hours or events.

- The urgent need of an ambulance or fire truck.

- Uneven traffic flow, where one lane is congested while another is empty.

- Pedestrian crossing needs.

## Our Intelligent 3-Tier Architecture
We've engineered a multi-layered AI system where each component has a distinct and critical role, mimicking a human-like decision-making process.

### Tier 1: The Perception Layer (The Eyes)  
A state-of-the-art YOLOv8 Computer Vision model acts as our eyes on the street. It processes live video feeds to provide a constant stream of high-fidelity data:

- Detects & Classifies: Accurately identifies cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, and pedestrians.

- Counts & Tracks: Maintains a real-time count for each lane.

- Calculates Density: Measures queue lengths to understand congestion levels.  

### Tier 2: The Decision Layer (The Brain)  
The raw data is fed to our Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning agent. This is the strategic brain of the operation. It has been trained over thousands of simulations to learn the optimal traffic signal strategy. Its single goal: minimize wait times and maximize traffic throughput. It constantly asks, "What's the most efficient signal phase to activate right now?"  

### Tier 3: The Guardian Layer (The Supervisor)  
AI needs oversight. A powerful Rule-Based Optimization Engine acts as a guardian, supervising the Q-Learning agent's decisions to ensure safety, fairness, and responsiveness to critical events. This layer enforces non-negotiable rules:

- Emergency Vehicle Preemption: Detects emergency vehicles and initiates a high-priority override sequence to clear a path, saving precious seconds.

- Gridlock Prevention: If a queue length exceeds a critical threshold, it triggers an override to service that lane immediately.

- Starvation Prevention: A fairness timer ensures no vehicle waits indefinitely, guaranteeing a minimum level of service for all lanes.

## Key Features & Innovations  

| Innovation | Description & Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Adaptive Signal Control** | Green light duration is allocated based on real-world demand, not a fixed clock. **Impact:** Drastically reduces average wait times and vehicle idling. |
| **Emergency Preemption** | A professional-grade clearing sequence (`yellow` -> `all-red` -> `dedicated green`) provides a clear path for first responders. **Impact:** Saves lives by shortening emergency response times. |
| **Live Digital Twin Dashboard** | A real-time React dashboard visualizes every detected vehicle, AI decision, and signal state. **Impact:** Provides complete transparency and operational oversight for city traffic managers. |
| **Guaranteed Fairness** | Our ‚Äústarvation‚Äù prevention algorithm ensures that low-traffic lanes aren‚Äôt ignored, promoting equitable flow. **Impact:** Increases driver satisfaction and prevents isolated congestion. |
